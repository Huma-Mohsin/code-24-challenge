From this practicing, we concludedd that:-

1- when any variable create with using let and const keywords, they can only be accessed within a block.

2- when any variable declared with using let and const keywords,they cannot be accessed out of block, compiler doesnot interpret them and throw an error.

//Advantages of these let and const keyword :-

1-Clarity and Readability:

Explicit declaration enhances code readability and understanding, making code easier to maintain.

2-Safer Code: 

Reduces the risk of naming conflicts and unintended side effects, resulting in safer and more predictable code.

3- No Redeclaration: 

Variables can't be redeclared within the same scope, reducing errors and promoting cleaner code.

and so only.
